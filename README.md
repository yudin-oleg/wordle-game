# Wordle

My implemetation of the famous Wordle Game where player has to unravel the word.

## Rules

You have to guess the hidden word in 6 tries and the color of the letters changes to show how close you are.
To start the game, just enter any word. The colors of the entered letters will help you to understand how close you are to the solution.
For instance if the letters colored with grey there is no this letter in the word. If it is colored with yellow it is in the word but
at the another position than you entered. If it is colored with green you are correct about the letter and its position in the hidden word.
